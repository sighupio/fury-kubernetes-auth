# Kubernetes Fury Auth add-on module v0.0.1

This is a maintenance release of the new `auth` module.

The content of this module is packages that were already present in other modules and have been grouped in this new module because of their functional nature.

There are no updates to the versions of the components in this realese so users can start using the module without major modifications to their code. We have included a minor patch to Dex's deployment to make it work on Kubernetes version 1.21 and later.

Successive releases will include updates to the components.
