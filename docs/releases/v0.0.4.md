## New features ðŸŒŸ

- Enabled Pomerium metrics and a ServiceMonitor to configure Prometheus Operator to scrape them automatically.
- Added 2 Grafana dashboards to visualize Pomerium's metrics, one for Pomerium itself and another one for the underlying Envoy proxy.

## Breaking Changes ðŸ’”

There are three breaking changes in this version:

1. Pomerium has deprecated the [`policy`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/policy/policy) field in the configuration in favour of [`routes`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/routes). You'll need to adapt your policy file to the new format.
2. Value of `grpc_address` in Pomerium's configuration must be different form `address`. See the [example policy](https://github.com/sighupio/fury-kubernetes-auth/blob/v0.0.3/katalog/pomerium/config/policy.example.yaml).
3. Forward mode has been deprecated in Pomerium 0.21.

## Update Guide ðŸ¦®

### Process

To upgrade this module from `v0.0.2` to `v0.0.3`, you need to download this new version and do the following changes **before** applying the `kustomize` project:

1. Edit your policy configuration file to use `routes` instead of `policy`, for example, from:

```yaml
policy:
  # from and to should be set to the prometheus ingress
  - from: https://prometheus.example.com
    to: https://prometheus.example.com
    allowed_idp_claims:
      groups:
        # ldap groups configured in dex
        - group1
        - group2
```

to:

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://prometheus.example.com
    to: https://prometheus.monitoring.svc  # notice the internal service. See (2.) below.
    policy:
      - allow:
          or:
            - claim/groups: group1
            - claim/groups: group2
            # - email:
               # is: someone@sighup.io

```

2. Forward auth mode has been deprecated by Pomerium in v0.21.0 (the one included in this release), you will need to switch to proxy auth.

If you were using forward auth with annotations in your ingresses, you will need to adjust them.

For example, if you had an ingress for Grafana in the `monitoring` namespace with the following annotations:

```yaml
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: "https://pomerium.example.com/verify?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://pomerium.example.com/?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
```

You will have to:

2.1. Create a new ingress in the `pomerium` namespace with the hostname for Grafana using the `pomerium` service and the `http` as backend configuration.
2.2. In the policy definition file, make sure that the `from` field matches the hostname and that the `to` field points to grafana's service (the one same that the ingress in the monitoring namespace).
2.3. Delete the Ingress in the `monitoring` namespace.
2.4 Repeat for the other ingresses.

3. Finally, apply the kustomization project:

```bash
kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -
```
