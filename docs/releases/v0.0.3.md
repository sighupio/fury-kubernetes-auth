# Auth Module Release v0.0.3

Welcome to the latest release of the Auth module for the Kubernetes Fury Distribution.

This is a maintenance release to update the Pomerium package. This update includes [breaking changes](#breaking-changes-) in Pomerium.

## Included packages

| Package    | Current Version                                                           | Previous Version |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `dex`      | [`v2.35.3`](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/releases/tag/v2.35.3)           | No update        |
| `gangway`  | [`v3.2.0`](https://github.com/vmware-archive/gangway/releases/tag/v3.2.0) | No update        |
| `pomerium` | [`v0.19.1`](https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium/releases/tag/v0.19.1)    | `0.15.8`         |

## Breaking Changes ðŸ’”

There are two breaking changes in this version:

1. Pomerium has deprecated the [`policy`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/policy/policy) field in the configuration in favour of [`routes`](https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/routes). You'll need to adapt your policy file to the new format.
2. Pomerium now requires two separated ingresses instead of routing everything through just one. One for authentication forward and another for Pomerium itself.
3. Value of `grpc_address` in Pomerium's configuration must be different form `address`.

### Process

To upgrade this module from `v0.0.2` to `v0.0.3`, you need to download this new version and do the following changes **before** applying the `kustomize` project:

1. Edit the `config.env` file and change your `FORWARD_AUTH_HOST` cofiguration to a different host than the `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_HOST`.

   Please beware that a new `pomerium-fwd` Ingress will be created with this new host. You might need to patch this ingress as you did before for the `pomerium` ingress (for example, set the right ingress class or certificate issuer).

   Note also that all ingress that you want to authenticate with Pomerium must have the annotation pointing to `FORWARD_AUTH_HOST` and **not** to `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_HOST`. `AUTHENTICATE_SERVICE_HOST` is used by Dex for the callback.
3. Edit your policy configuration file to use `routes` instead of `policy`, for example, from:

```yaml
policy:
  # from and to should be set to the prometheus ingress
  - from: https://prometheus.example.com
    to: https://prometheus.example.com
    allowed_idp_claims:
      groups:
        # ldap groups configured in dex
        - group1
        - group2
```

to:

```yaml
routes:
  - from: https://prometheus.example.com
    to: https://prometheus.example.com
    policy:
      - allow:
          or:
            - claim/groups: group1
            - claim/groups: group2
            # - email:
               # is: someone@sighup.io

```

1. Update all the ingresses annotations or Dex configuration depending on which Ingress you've chosen as forward auth and which ingress for the authenticate service. For example, if you decided to use a new hostname for the forward auth, change from:

```yaml
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: "https://pomerium.example.com/verify?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://pomerium.example.com/?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
```

to

```yaml
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: "https://pomeriumfwd.example.com/verify?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: "https://pomeriumfwd.example.com/?uri=$scheme://$host$request_uri"
```

4. Finally, apply the kustomization project:

```bash
kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -
```
